## Command-Line Tool to Open Projects in preferred IDE or Text Editor

## WHY?

I know the `code` command already exists for VS Code, but I've been using Atom lately and it doesn't hurt to learn new things.

## HOW?

Run `program . or FOLDER_PATH` in terminal.

NOTE: Currently written for Atom. VS Code Coming Soon.
